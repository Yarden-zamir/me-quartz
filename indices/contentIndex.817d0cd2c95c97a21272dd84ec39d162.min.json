To change that we need to take a look at the evaluation that our brains go though when avoiding such activities `Action Potential = Perceived Value / Friction` and take it apart step by step, then work to reinstate our mindset with this as a principle\n\nWe have an **Action Desire** which doesn't correlate with the **Action Potential** for this same action, to make it correlate there are a few things we can modify.\n\nThis could be wanting to learn a new language or it could be wanting not to eat sugar (in which case the Action Desire is low and the action potential is high)\n\n- Manipulate perceived value of action\n- Manipulate friction of action\n- Manipulate perceived value of inverse action\n- Manipulate friction of inverse action\n\n\u003e [!IDEA] Random tangent - how would this look with [[Branch based writing]]?\n\u003e - Manipulate [Action's, Inverse Action's]\n\u003e \t- perceived value\n\u003e \t- friction\n\n## The Action's Attributes\nThe easiest way we know to \"motivate\" us is to modify the existing actions attributes. This is the classic approach\n\n### Perceived Value \nWe can increase the perceived value of an action by using different actions to increase the **Action Potential**, we can do that by thinking how amazing it would be to preform such action and how many rewards we would reap afterwards, we can promise ourselves things, lie to ourselves, make the value proposition high which in turn makes us more likely to go though.\n\n### Friction (or Perceived Difficulty, Price )\nWe can reduce friction of the action with other actions by doing some of the process ahead of time, making the situation more clear (when things are unclear or uncertain we tend to avoid taking action = increase friction) or acquiring help from others\n\n## The Environment Attributes\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Alignment-of-Interest":{"title":"","content":" - [l] [[The Sovereign Mind|The Sovereign Mind]]\n---\nAlignment of interest is something that, I would argue, we don't take into account enough in our everyday lives.\nIt is the effect when two or more sides have interests that align, thus making the pursuit of said interests easier. \n\nActive thinking over our day to day exchange dynamics\n\n### People you want things from\nThe most common situation that makes us think of this concept is our interaction with other people. If I want something from someone, it is important for me to make it in his interest to help me achieve it, eg: buying things: you are making the interest of giving you that bag of groceries a reality when you pay, by making \"paying\" your interest, you align yours with theirs, same as the merchant does when he makes the interest of giving \"his\" stuff to you. Generally you don't want to give your money, but when that interest is required to accomplish another that you do, you work to align those. \n- [I] This is a system, an economical system that is constructed external to us and we relay on it. We can construct similar systems ourselves (and we do)\n\n### People you care about\nWe don't always make this \"tit for tat\" so directly on the surface though, a good example of that is people that we love, friends, family members, etc. We are a lot less likely to expect payment from a friend when we expend energy to help them pursue an interest of theirs then we are to help a random stranger with the same thing. But of course, we **want** to help our loved one s, it is in our interest. A mother will go to immense lengths to help her kids achieve their interests because she really wants to do so, it is in her interests.\n - [I] **Interest is not equal to Perceived Interest** -  When we help someone with their interest it's not always their actual interests or even communicated interests but instead **inferred interest** the thing we think they need.\n^55353a\n\n### Random people, the world\n Sometimes it is also in our interest to just help somebody out, we are a social species and it is in our nature to help each other to an extent; if someone dropped some books, forgot to bring cash to get coffee in the morning, got lost and needs direction most people will help out because we want to help, but we don't (by default) want to invest a lot of energy without getting some back, so if those same people asked for money to buy a computer, a ride to far away place, your shoes, we are much less likely to comply. But this \"calculation\" goes the other way too, in cases where our help is more urgent and important we still find ourselves helping, a case of life and death for example.\n\n### You\nYes you, the entity you negotiate most with is yourself. Every small thing you want to do and is hard is a negotiation where you try to align interests with yourself. You not always \"interested\" in doing the dishes very much, but it is in your interest that your things will be more organized, less stinky etc. Which leads to aligned interests, enough elements in you agree that washing dishes is a cause worth pursuing that it happens eventually. Well... or it doesn't, sometimes you make that argument and it doesn't catch, sometimes the cost to benefit calculation doesn't add up well enough and enough of you thinks it's not in it's interest to do such a thing right now, I'll do it later....\n\n### Services\nA really interesting thing is that like people, services are built on [[Alignment of Interest|Alignment of Interest]], any service you use weather it is free parking, hotel food delivery or google maps, has their interests aligned with yours, and yours with them to an extent, a lot of suffering comes from the lack of alignment, or lack of clarity on the matter. You are frustrated that [[WHY do I pay Adobe 10K a YEAR!|Adobe doesn't fix their bugs and crushes in their software?]] Well too bad, because your interest in having a bug free software to use do not align well enough with their interest to line their pockets, (a case that happens a lot in [[monopolies]] of any kind) they know you are not going anywhere, because they know [[WHY do I pay Adobe 10K a YEAR!|there is nowhere to go ]] and so sure, they would like to have software that works better, but is that interest strong enough compared to the others? Evidently no. Not only is it not strong enough, it even conflicts with some interests! To fix their crap, they'll need to expend money and energy, while they know they already have the market, which means they are not going to gain any meaningful amount of new customers, nor will they make much more money in general with that approach (it can be argued that in the long run it will be beneficial for them to do so as at some point there will be competition and they should be ready, but evidently they did the math on this one and decided it's not worth it, remember, [[Alignment of Interest#^55353a|]]).\nWhen you use google services for free, we all know there is still payment, you pay with your time (watching ads), data and your privacy but their is an alignment of interest because you decide it's worth it as their tools are too valuable to loose\n\n### Tools and \"passive\" interest\nIn general tools, be it software or mechanical real life ones like a shovel, are bound by this principle in a sometimes-abstract way. Media Player's \"interest\" is to help you consume standard media files, as long this aligns with your interest of watching you pirated pirates of the carabian movie all is well. But if you decide you also want automatic subtitle download, advanced streaming, live annotations etc. The interests would not align anymore and you would need to find another tool. \nSame goes for a shovel, it won't help you cut a tree down very much, so you need to use a different tool. It is \"Not interested in helping you\" in a way.\nThis sort of interest is called **passive interest** as it's the given tool or element passively posses it. A concept that lives in the users mind \n\n---\nAs you can see a lot of times **interest** aligns with **ability**, a shovel's passive interest would be to dig a hole, because it matches it's ability, same as when a teacher is more likely to help you learn and a food store is more likely to sell you food. They have the ability to do so, which underlines and bases the negotiation process. no matter how much you try to align interests with a dog to do your homework, it's not going to work because it doesn't have the ability to do so. \nWhile the \nFor inanimate objects the interest is still based on ability but doesn't have anything on top of it so it always is equal to it's ability\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Arcane-Batch-1":{"title":"","content":"# Arcane\n## Links\n- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81446667?trackId=14183263)   \n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_(TV_series))\n- [[Arcane - Batch 2|Batch 2]]\n## Comment:\n  The show is \"crunchy\", really well animated, really good sound, written pretty well and is overall awesome. \n  Rating::90\n\tConsumed:: true","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Arcane-Batch-2":{"title":"","content":" \n# Arcane\n## Links\n- [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81446667?trackId=14183263)   \n- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_(TV_series))\n- [[Arcane - Batch 1|Batch 1]]\n## Comment:\nReally amazing, above and beyond amazing, every character is gold, story and development is top notch, crazy good animation.

More than half of the entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene, a precursor to styrene, which is used to make polymers and plastics like polystyrene and EPS. Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce phenol and acetone for resins and adhesives. Cyclohexane consumes around 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into textiles and engineering plastics. Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and pesticides. In 2013, the biggest consumer country of benzene was China, followed by the USA. Benzene production is currently expanding in the Middle East and in Africa, whereas production capacities in Western Europe and North America are stagnating.[52]\n\n### Proposed\n- Benzene is used\n\t- mainly as an intermediate to make other chemicals\n\t\t- ethylbenzene\n\t\t\t- More than half of entire benzene production is processed into ethylbenzene\n\t\t\t- precursor to styrene which is used to make\n\t\t\t- Polymers\n\t\t\t- Plastics\n\t\t- cumene\n\t\t\t- Some 20% of the benzene production is used to manufacture cumene, which is needed to produce\n\t\t\t\t- phenol\n\t\t\t\t- acetone\n\t\t\t\t- resins and adhesives\n\t\t- cyclohexane\n\t\t\t- consumes around 10% of the world's benzene production; it is primarily used in the manufacture of nylon fibers, which are processed into\n\t\t\t\t- textiles\n\t\t\t\t- engineering plastics\n\t\t- nitrobenzene\n\t\t- alkylbenzene\n\t\t    - Cyclohexane\n\t\t    - Smaller amounts of benzene are used to make some types of\n\t\t        - rubbers,\n\t\t        - lubricants,\n\t\t        - dyes,\n\t\t        - detergents,\n\t\t        - drugs,\n\t\t        - explosives\n\t\t        - pesticides\n- In 2013, the biggest benzene consumer countries were\n\t- China\n\t- USA\n- Benzene production is currently expanding in\n\t- the Middle East\n\t- Africa\n- Benzene production is currently stagnating in\n\t- Western Europe\n\t - North America\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Breadwater":{"title":"","content":" \nAn alternative name for beer","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Catch-22":{"title":"","content":"# Catch-22\n## Metadata\n* Author: [Joseph Heller and Howard Jacobson](https://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Heller/e/B000APVA6I/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1)\n* ASIN: B0050OMJIW\n* ISBN: 978-0099470465\n* Reference: [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050OMJIW]]\n* [Kindle link](kindle://book?action=open\u0026asin=B0050OMJIW)\n\n## Highlights\nClevinger really thought he was right, but Yossarian had proof, because strangers he didn’t know shot at him with cannons every time he flew up into the air to drop bombs on them, and it wasn’t funny at all.

This is how I classify those.\n### Launcher\nIn our digital lives we have many forms of launchers, the core idea is a place where you can easily launch a tool to aid in a specific need fast. \nexamples:\n- Desktop\n\t- 2 dimensional\n\t-  Large, many shortcuts\n\t- Can be used for temporary storage\n\t- Can be used as work area\n\t- Folders\n- Taskbar\n\t- Always visible\n\t- Quick\n\t- Shows active programs\n- Start menu (windows)\n\t- Searchable\n\t- Available with button click \n\t- 2d (win10)\n\t- Folders\n\t- Easy to click (As [[Fitts law]] explains, the buttons have infinite effective height when calculating clicability),\n- Browser bookmark bar\n\t- Always visible while in browser\n\t- Folders\n- Browser bookmarks\n\t- Easy to add to\n- Browser new tab page\n- Phone launcher (main screen)\n### Processing canvas\nThe core of the workflow, this is where ideas develop and memories stored, where views are solidified and liquified, and where the past present and future are evaluated. \n#### Specifications\n- Need to be able to write and consume information in a comfortable accessible way\n- Need to be resilient and none-fragile, future proof\n\t- [!] Using a frail notebook or an online service that controls your data with no personal control both are examples of what to be weary of. Both are better than nothing though, write on toilet paper if you have to\n- Need to have low friction, never use a tool that makes it difficult to use for the desired purpose. \n\t- [!] [[Notion]] was an example of that, wanted to use it as a not taking service but the app takes about ten seconds to load. When I have an idea I have to wait ten seconds to even interact with the app and then a few more seconds as it loads my notes page and lets me create a new one.\n- Using it needs to be a fun experience - make it look good, make sure to keep it organized and don't forgive gripes and flaws that hurt the experience, a tool of this sort, that would be used every day is something worth investing energy into.\n\t- [!] Never let optimization override the process itself though, again, the most important thing is to process, write and explore at the end of the day. \n\n### Calendar\n### Todo list\n## Tools that you **shouldn't** need\n#### Inbox\nMost digital workflows involve the use of an inbox of some sort where you put all of the unfiltered input and then at a set time you go though and slowly chip away at the list to funnel the entries into their respective spaces and tools.\nAnyone who used this flow before knows that it doesn't always work. You get the joy of collecting many cool shiny things from the side of the road, yes, but turning those into actionable, useful, insightful information is where this route may be lacking. The friction for slotting things into the inbox is usually very low, the reward is quite high (see [[Action Potential model|Action Potential]] for why that matters), you feel productive when you shove the box full of things. \nOn the other hand taking things and processing them may be more complicated, and it is almost always the case that it is at least slightly harder than adding to the list, then, naturally that means the inbox will grow faster than it shrinks, leading to an infinite backlog.\n\n##### Alternative\nInstead of having an inbox, the process of funneling should be as automated / easy / fast to use as possible.","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Dr.-Vassilia-Binensztok":{"title":"","content":" \n\u003e “When you’re not used to being confident, confidence feels like arrogance.\n\u003e When you’re used to being passive, assertiveness feels like aggression.\n\u003e When you’re not used to getting your needs met, prioritizing yourself feels selfish.\n\u003e Your comfort zone is not a good benchmark.“\n\u003e — Dr. Vassilia Binensztok","lastmodified":"2022-11-21T13:02:41.982544995Z","tags":null},"/Fear":{"title":"","content":"\nI [[feeling]] I must explore more.

Simple, yet sufficient for this thought experiment\n\nNow, in the development of Humanity, there are a few elements that relay on evolution, the simplest one would be genetic evolution, where each iteration is a \"trial\" for a set of genes based on the last with slight changes.
