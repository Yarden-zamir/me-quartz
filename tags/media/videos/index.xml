Comment: this woman comes up to a psychiatrist I think this is in this chapter and she says you know I&amp;rsquo;m having a really rough time of it I&amp;rsquo;m suffering badly my life is not going well and and then she says I hope that there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with me and the psychiatrist she says well here&amp;rsquo;s how I look at it there&amp;rsquo;s either something wrong with the world and I&amp;rsquo;m just in it and that&amp;rsquo;s how it is and then like what am I going to do about that because it&amp;rsquo;s the whole world or maybe I could be fortunate and there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with me that&amp;rsquo;s causing all this unnecessary suffering and if I could just** set it right I could learn and I could set it right</description></item></channel></rss>
